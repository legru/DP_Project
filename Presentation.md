Data to answer these questions...
========================================================

Data from UNHCR tells the story of all World refugees

If we look at Refugees out of Syria we see where they are...

... They are still in Syria trying to weather the war and go home

... if they live they stop in Turkey, or in Lebanon

... Very few of them go to Europe

But hey wait a minute...
========================================================

There is something unexpected in the data

Look at the Asylum numbers...

Refugees look for asylum in Europe:  when they will be discouraged they will all go there!

May be,  but what if they needs Asylum to stay in Europe,  but do not need it to stay in other countries?
